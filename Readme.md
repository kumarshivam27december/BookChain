The **Book Exchange Platform** is a web application designed to facilitate the exchange of books within a community.
Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), the platform allows users to list books they no longer need,
search for books they want, and communicate with other users to arrange swaps. The application is containerized using Docker to ensure consistency across development and production environments, and it includes a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
This project aims to provide a simple, user-friendly solution for book enthusiasts to share and discover books while showcasing modern web development and DevOps practices.
